            <h2 >Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is a python data analysis project conducted to learn how runners performed in <strong> the San Francisco Marathon</strong> race of 2017. </p>
            <p>In order to have an insightful understanding of runners' performance, the San Francisco Marathon race results and Strava applicaiton users' running records were used. Those information were gathered from the websites using techniques such as data scraping, data cleansing, and data visualization through python programing.</p>
            <p>Following questions were used to understand the sampled data demographics, significans of any outliers, and potential reasons behind how runners performed on the marathon race day.  </p>
            <h2 > Key questions: </h2>

         <ul>
            <li>What does the Strava user population look like compared to overall marathon runners?</li>
            <li>How did the Strava users perform at the race day compared to overall marathon runners?</li>
            <li>How did top 20 Strava users perform on the race day?</li>
            <li>What can we do to race for better performance?</li>
         </ul>

            <h2> Data source </h2>
            <p>Total of 1317 user running data was captured using data scraping technique to perform data gathering from the Strava website as well as the official San Francisco Marathon result page. The inforamtion was first formatted, and then used to learn about the different demographics of the Strava users compared to the 2017 San Francisco Marathon official results.</p>

            <h2>Strava user demographics</h2>
            <p>We first wanted to understnad what type of sampled demographics we are looking at when using Strava information compared to the overall population of the San Francisco marathon participants.
               When we looked at the strava user population, we found that close to 19% of the total marathon runners were using Strava to monitor thier race performance.
               Further more when looking the population by strava users by gender, the Strava users were made by 14% male and 4.9% female popultation compared to the total runners.
               From this data we learned that compared to the overall race participants, where the population is made by 64.1% male and 35.9% female, the Strava users had 74% and 26% respectively. This result in Strava users having higher ratio of male runners compared to the overall sampled population.

         <h2 > Race completion of Strava users by age and gender</h2>
            <p> Using the official San Francisco marathon race result, scatter plot was produced to show the runners' overall race results by gender and age.
                From this analysis, we can observe that the scatter plot is most dense between overall race result of 2:46:40 to 6:56:40.
                There were no apparent observation of race performance based on gender, however there is a positive corrolation between runners' age and the overall time to complete the marathon.
                We observed that the younger the runner is, the more likely the overall performance result in faster completion time.
            </p>
            <p> Plotting the same race result for Strava users, we can see that the scatter plot is most dense between overall reace result of 2:46:40 to 5:33:20.
                The same positve corrolation between the age and the overall performance result is observed, and assuming from having more male population in the sample,the race results mean are faster compared to the overall population.

            <h2 > Performance comparison between Strava users and overall race result</h2>
            <p>Race results for the San Francisco marathon has normal distribution curve.
               As Strava users population have more male population compared to the overall sample, Strava users runs 19:16 faster on average, but Strava users have higher spread in standard deviation.
